## If you don't know what you are doing, thats fine.
As long as you know how to edit text files, you can probably help

If you're a staff member, keeping the buttons up to date and organized is important, and as long as you keep the arrays under 25 items, it should be very easy to add an entry without any help. If you DO need help, let NEvana know.

And if you aren't a staff member, adding to the splash text could be a good way to contribute as well. just add the entry and the activity type. Follow the comments, create a pull request.
